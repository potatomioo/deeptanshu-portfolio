              I'm a product-focused software engineer who thrives at the intersection of technology and user experience. 
              With a proven track record of building scalable systems that serve millions of users, I specialize in 
              creating solutions that don't just work—they excel.

              My journey spans across mobile platforms, where I've architected cross-platform solutions using Kotlin 
              Multiplatform, designed seamless payment systems handling millions of transactions, and ventured into 
              the cutting-edge world of AR/VR and metaverse technologies.

              What sets me apart? I don't just write code—I solve problems. Every line of code I write is driven by 
              product thinking, user empathy, and a deep understanding of business needs. Whether it's optimizing 
              payment success rates, reducing user drop-offs, or creating immersive virtual experiences, I bring 
              both technical excellence and strategic insight to every project.
